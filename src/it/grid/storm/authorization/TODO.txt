TODO:

- Need to rework the configuration file format to XML or another
  hierarchical one, to exploit the new tree structure of AuthzSources;
  Jakarta XMLBeans is probably the way to go.


- move the class finding algortihm from config.Configuration to a
  local (private) class, so that AuthorizationCollector will be the
  only package-public class (is this useful? probably not)


DONE:

- create a CompositeAuthorizationSource class, which has the same
  logic as the AuthorizationCollector, thus allowing to have *trees*
  of authorization sources, each branching node having its own
  combining algorithm.

  Then, AuthorizationCollector will be just the root instance of
  CombiningAuthorizationSource.
