The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of [StoRM 1.11.10][release-notes] that
includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.10][backend-rn]
* StoRM WebDAV v. [1.0.4][webdav-rn]
* StoRM GridHTTPs v. [3.0.4][gridhttps-rn]
* StoRM Info Provider v. [1.7.9][info-provider-rn]

It's **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to update your StoRM WebDAV (or GridHTTPs) component in order to avoid a security issue which affects an external java library included. This release includes several other minor fixes and improvements, as highlighted in the
[release notes][release-notes].

This release doesn't require a YAIM reconfiguration. The updated services must
be restarted:

```bash
service storm-backend-server restart
service storm-webdav restart
/usr/libexec/storm-info-provider configure; service bdii restart
```

The restart of *storm-gridhttps-server* has not been reported cause it's highly recommended to update it to *storm-webdav*.

Packages can be obtained from our repositories and will soon be available on
the EMI-3 repository. Follow the instructions in the
[download section][download-page].
