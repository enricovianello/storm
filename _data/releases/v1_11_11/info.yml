  This release:

    * fixes a StoRM backend issue that prevented correct startup on Java 6 and 7

  and introduces:

    * a mechanism to gather metrics about synchronous operations load and
    performance (see [sys-admin guide logging section](!SITE_URL!/documentation/sysadmin-guide/1.11.11/#storm-backend-metricslog));
    * changes to the Request Garbage Collector's default configuration, which now
    implements an adaptive mechanism to keep the request database dimension under
    control in high-load scenarios (see
    [sys-admin guide requests-garbage-collector section](!SITE_URL!/documentation/sysadmin-guide/1.11.11/#requests-garbage-collector)).

installation: >
  To upgrade to StoRM v.1.11.11, first of all update the involved packages:

      yum update -y storm-backend-server

  Check your `/etc/storm/backend-server` directory, you should find a new file:
  `logging.xml.rpmnew`. Backup your current logging configuration and replace it
  with the newest:

      cd /etc/storm/backend-server
      cp logging.xml logging.xml.backup
      cp logging.xml.rpmnew logging.xml

  Restart StoRM Backend service:

      service storm-backend-server restart
