The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of [StoRM 1.11.11][release-notes] that
includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.11][backend-rn]

This release provides an important bug fix on StoRM Backend due to a covariance issue on Java code, introduced with StoRM v1.11.10.

Then, it's **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to upgrade your installation. See the [release notes][release-notes] for more details.

**How to update**

Packages can be obtained from our repositories (see the instructions in the [download section][download-page]) and will soon be available on the EMI-3 repository.

- Update and restart StoRM Backend service:

```bash
yum update storm-backend-server
service storm-backend-server restart
```

Alternatively, you can update and run YAIM.

You can find more information about upgrade, clean installation and configuration of
StoRM services in the [System Administration Guide][storm-sysadmin-guide].
