The StoRM 1.11.2 release provides several bug fixes as highlighted in the [release notes][release-notes].

This release was initially foreseen for mid July but was delayed as issues kept being discovered by the sites running v.1.11.1, and lately the preview versions providing fixes. We worked closely with the production sites of **INFN Tier-1** and **QMUL**, where a preview of this release has been running for more than a week with high loads and real use cases, providing them near real-time fixes as they reported problems. This was made possible by our continuos integration infrastructure, which let sites install from a preview yum repo a few minutes after a change in the code is made. The result of this continuos feedback from production use is a release that has already undergone weeks of real running, and thus promise to be robust and stable. Thanks to the people operating StoRM at **INFN-CNAF** and **QMUL** for the collaboration.

About the **StoRM Backend**, one of the first problems solved was the large amount of threads created. We discovered that this large amount of threads was generated by the high number of abort requests due to the operations latency caused by a malformed query on the database. 
Another important issue that we discovered and fixed was about the GPFS quota computation: the StoRM Backend could stop updating the quota information in the StoRM database. 
This issue was caused by an improper sharing of a bounded threadpool between the thread that submits the GPFS Quota computation tasks and the workers that perform the quota computation. 
Together with the StoRM Backend, the **StoRM Frontend** was updated with a pair of significant fixes about the returned fileSize of a prepare-to-get or prepare-to-put, that caused some failures at client side, such as with FTS. 
The **StoRM GridHTTPs Server** has not undergone significant changes, but only some optimizations and some adjustments regarding configuration. 
A pair of bugs were fixed for **StoRM Native Libs**.
Finally, the updates to **YAIM StoRM** fixed some issues about StoRM configuration (StoRM user wasn't properly changeable, type of checksum should be no longer configurable, etc) and the GLUE2 information published.

In order to avoid regressions as much as we could, we are still working to enhance our [testsuite][storm-testsuite] based on the [Robot framework][robot-framework].
Each time a new issue is found or new functionality is added, new tests are added to verify the correct behaviour of the clients.

For all the release details, see the [release notes][release-notes].

<span class="label label-info">important</span> If you have installed our developers' repository, when the EMI3 repository will be updated, or after you installed our production repository, you must remove the developers' repo and reinstall the involved components.

<span class="label label-info">important</span> With StoRM 1.11.2 the StoRM Backend logging configuration file 'logging.xml' has been modified so you have to manually replace this file with the .rpmnew or merge your configuration.
