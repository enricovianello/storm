The StoRM Product Team is pleased to announce the release of [StoRM
1.11.11][release-notes] that includes the following updated components:

* StoRM Backend v. [1.11.11][backend-rn]

This release:

* fixes a StoRM backend issue that prevented correct startup on Java 6 and 7

and introduces:

* a mechanism to gather metrics about synchronous operations load and
  performance (see [sys-admin guide logging
  section]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sysadmin-guide/1.11.11/#storm-backend-metricslog));
* changes to the Request Garbage Collector's default configuration, which now
  implements an adaptive mechanism to keep the request database dimension under
  control in high-load scenarios (see [sys-admin guide
  requests-garbage-collector
  section]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/sysadmin-guide/1.11.11/#requests-garbage-collector)).

See the [release notes][release-notes] for more details.

Packages can be obtained from our repositories (see the instructions in the
[download section][download-page]) and will soon be available on the EMI-3
