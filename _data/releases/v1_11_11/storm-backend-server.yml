description: >
  This release:

    * fixes a StoRM backend issue that prevented correct startup on Java 6 and 7

  and introduces:

    * a mechanism to gather metrics about synchronous operations load and
    performance (see [sys-admin guide logging section](!SITE_URL!/documentation/sysadmin-guide/1.11.11/#storm-backend-metricslog));
    * changes to the Request Garbage Collector's default configuration, which now
    implements an adaptive mechanism to keep the request database dimension under
    control in high-load scenarios (see
    [sys-admin guide requests-garbage-collector section](!SITE_URL!/documentation/sysadmin-guide/1.11.11/#requests-garbage-collector)).
