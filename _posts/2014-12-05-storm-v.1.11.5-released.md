A new YAIM variable has been added: STORM\_GRIDHTTPS\_PUBLIC\_HOST (see [StoRM Backend configuration section][be-conf]). 
If your StoRM deployment provides a WebDAV endpoint, through the storm-gridhttps-server component, 
you must set this variable to the FQDN hostname of the machine where storm-gridhttps-server is 
installed in order to publish the correct WebDAV endpoint on the BDII.
