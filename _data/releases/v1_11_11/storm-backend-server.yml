description: >
  This release fixes a covariance issue on Java code, introduced with StoRM v1.11.10. This issue is verified when a default acl list is set for a storage area. In that case, StoRM Backend will fail on start.


  This release introduces also:

    * a new log file with finer grained metrics about synchronous operations (see [sys-admin guide logging section](!SITE_URL!/documentation/sysadmin-guide/1.11.11/#storm-backend-metricslog));
    * new default values for Requests Garbage Collector (see [sys-admin guide requests-garbage-collector section](!SITE_URL!/documentation/sysadmin-guide/1.11.11/#requests-garbage-collector)).

installation: >
  To install, update and restart StoRM Backend:
